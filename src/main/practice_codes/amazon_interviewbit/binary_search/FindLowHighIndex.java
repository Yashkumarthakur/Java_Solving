/**
 * Find Low/High Index
 * Problem Statement
 * Given a sorted array of integers, return the low and high index of the given key. You must return -1 if the indexes are not found.
 *
 * The array length can be in the millions with many duplicates.
 *
 * In the following example, according to the the key, the low and high indices would be:
 * Input : 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
 *
 * Low Index of 5: 15
 * High Index of 5: 17
 * Low Index of -2: -1
 * High Index of -2: -1
 *
 *
 * Hint
 * Binary Search
 *
 *
 * Solution Explanation
 * Runtime complexity
 * Since we are using binary search, the runtime complexity is logarithmic, O(logn).
 *
 * Memory complexity
 * The memory complexity is constant, O(1) since no extra storage is being used.
 *
 *
 * Solution Breakdown
 * Linearly scanning the sorted array for low and high indices are highly inefficient since our array size can be in millions.
 * Instead, we will use a slightly modified binary search to find the low and high indices of a given key.
 * We need to do binary search twice;
 * once for finding the low index.
 * once for finding the high index.
 *
 * Low index
 * Letâ€™s look at the algorithm for finding the low index:
 * At every step, consider the array between low and high indices and calculate the mid index.
 * If the element at mid index is less than the key, low becomes mid + 1 (to move towards the start of range).
 * If the element at mid is greater or equal to the key, the high becomes mid - 1. Index at low remains the same.
 * When low is greater than high, low would be pointing to the first occurrence of the key.
 * If the element at low does not match the key, return -1.
 *
 * High index
 * Similarly, we can find the high index by slightly modifying the above condition:
 * switch the low index to mid + 1 when element at mid index is less than or equal to the key.
 * switch the high index to mid - 1 when the element at mid is greater than the key.
